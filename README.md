# Automate deployment of environments using Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. It is an open source tool that codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared amongst team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned.

In this tutorial, you will use a sample configuration to provision a **L**inux virtual server, with **A**pache web server, **M**ySQL, and **P**HP server termed as **LAMP** stack. You will then update the configuration to add an Object Storage service and scale the resources to tune the environment (memory, CPU, and disk size). Finish by deleting all of the resources created by the configuration.
