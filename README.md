# Infrastructure as Code - Terraform
Terraform enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. It is an open source tool that codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared amongst team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned.

In this tutorial, you will use a IBM provided Terraform template in to provision a Linux virtual server, with Apache web server, MySQL, and PHP server (LAMP stack). You will then configure the template to add an Object Storage service and scale the resources to tune the environment (memory, CPU and disk size). Finish by deleting all of the resources created by the configuration.
